add() function accepts only Object.  add(Object e);

  t1. if add() takes the object as a parameter then how it takes int, float, char?
	Object is the bass class for all class in java. So it supports all parameters of its child class.

  t2. what is the use of iterator while using java collections?

  t3. what is the diff btw Iterator and listIterator?

  t4. what is the functional diff btw the collections mentioned below:
	ArrayList Vs LinkedList Vs Vector
	HashSet Vs TreeSet Vs LinkedHashSet

topics covered, 
	iterator
	linkedlist- easy for manipulation, but tough for adding/storing elements
	hashset  -  avoids duplication in elements
	treeset  -  arranges in sorted manner, and avoids duplication in elements

1. program to Iterate LinkedList in reverse order.

2. program to swap 2 elements in an ArrayList.

3. program to convert HashSet into TreeSet.

4. program to check whether an element exist in LinkedList.

5. program to remove first and last element of LinkedList.
