1. write a program to accept age from user, if age>18, than display msg that user is eligible for voting, but in other case, program must throw the exception regarding invalid age entry.
class invalidaException extends Exception
{
	invalidaException(String a)
	{
		super(s);
	}
}
class testException
{
	public void voteEligible(int age) throws invalidaException
	{
	if(age<18)
	{
		throw new invalidaException("not valid age");
	}
	else
	{
		System.out.println("Eligible for voting");
	}
	}
	public static void main(String a[])
	{
	try {
		voteEligible(13);
	}
	catch(invalidaException e)
	{
		System.out.println("exception occured");
	}
	}
}

BIG DATA
points to ponder during programming big data:
> how to read and write text data
> how to read and write binary data
> how to read and write xml data
> how to read the data from specific position of file
> how to read the data by using specific delimiter of file
> how to write data to specific position
> how to write data at the end of file
> how to read and write specific word or char from a given line
