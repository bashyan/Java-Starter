When data becomes too large for processing and management, then this data is big data.

volume, variety(structures, unstructures and semi structured), velocity, varasity, value

Big Data Analytics:
Hadoop is a framwork, written in java, open source by Apache.

Distributed file system: storing in divided data blocks, stored seperated making replica,
	 64/128 MB block fixed size.

HDFS: 	scalable(can add nodes and increase cluster(amount of data stored on that particular cluster(adding all HDD size of all machines)) size),-- no initial data device investment, can grow as demand grows, 
	reliable(as we have 3 replica(no replica in same machine), the data is reliable),
	manageable(can perform multiple operation in same machine) and 
	economical(commodity hardware, minimize BW consumption and latency)

stand by vs secondary
online is stand by, sec takes backup every 1 hr
